# Neural Network Playground

## General

This repo implements various methods for training simple neural networks. 
So far classic backpropagation and a faster optimiztion have been tested. 

It let's you create input data by a 3x5 matrix which was used to input images of digits.

## Getting started

For optimal performance I recommend to run this in a simple http server like 

  * python -m SimpleHTTPServer
  * python3 -m http.server
